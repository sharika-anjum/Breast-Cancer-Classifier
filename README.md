# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
A machine learning model which predicts whether the breast cancer is **Malignant** or **Benign cancer**, depending on certain input values. KNN algorithm used with an accuracy  of 98%.


**Cancer** occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way.

**Breast cancer** is a cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple.

# Risk Factors Of Breast Cancer

The Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having childern late in life or not at all, having prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. The exact cause of breast cancer remains unclear, but some risk factors make it more likely. And it is possible to prevent some of these risk factors.

**Age:**
The risk of breast cancer increases with age.At 20 years, the chance of developing breast cancer in the next decade is 0.06%. By the age of 70 years, this figure goes up to 3.84%.

**Genetics:**
Women who carry certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a higher chance of developng breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both. People inherit these genes from their parents. Mutations in the TP53 gene also have links to increased breast cancer risk. if a close relative has or had breast cancer, a person's chance of developing breast cancer increases.

**Previous History of Breast Cancer:**
Women who have previously had breast cancer are more likely to have it again than those who have no history of the disease. Having some types of noncancerous breast lump increases the chance of developing cancer later on. Examples include a typical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.

**Dense Breast Tissue:**
Women with more dense breasts are more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer.

**Estrogen Exposure And Breastfeeding:**
Extended exposure to estrogen appears to increase the risk of breast cancer. This could be due to a person starting their periods earlier or entering Menopause at a later than average age. Between these times, estrogen levels are higher. Breastfeeding, especially for over 1 year, appears to reduce the chance of developing breast cancer. This is possible due to the drop in estrogen exposure that follows pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Body Weight:**
Women who become overweight or develop obesity after menopause may also have a higher chance of developing breast cancer, possible due to increased estrogen levels. High sugar intake may also be a factor

**Hormone Treatments:**
According to the NCI, studies have shown that oral contraceptives may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer. According to the ACS, studies have found that Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) , specifically estrogen-progesterone therapy (EPT), is related to an Increased Risk of breast cancer.

The uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthly breast tissue and can travel to the lymph nodes under the arms. The lymph nodes are a primary pathway that help the cancer cells move to other parts of the body.

# Prevention Of Breast Cancer

**Lifestyle Factors**
Lifestyle factors can affect the risk of breast cancer. For instance, women who are obese have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Maintaining a healthy diet and getting more exercise could help you lose weight and lower your risk.

Drinking too much alcohol also increases the risk. This is true of having two or more drinks per day, and of binge drinking. However, one study found that even one drink per day increases the risk of breast cancer.

**Breast Cancer Screening**
Having regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the odds that it will go undetected. The American College of Physicians (ACP) provides the following general recommendations for women at average risk for breast cancer:

**Women ages 40 to 49:** An annual mammogram isn't recommended, but women should discuss their preference with their doctors.
**Women ages 50 to 74:** A mammogram every other year is recommended.
**Women 75 and older:** Mammogram are no longer recommended.
